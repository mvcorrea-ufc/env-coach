This project uses [env-coach](https://github.com/your-repo/env-coach) for AI-assisted development.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize env-coach in your project (uses current directory name)
env-coach init

# Or specify a custom name
env-coach init "MyProject"

# Check project status and LLM connectivity
env-coach status

# Add requirements in natural language
env-coach add-requirement "I want to build a REST API for user management"

# View and manage backlog
env-coach list-backlog

# Work with user stories
env-coach add-story --title "User Authentication" --description "Login system"
env-coach list-stories

# Plan sprints (coming soon)
env-coach plan-sprint --goal "MVP development"

# Start development workflow
env-coach start-task <task-id>
env-coach assist-task <task-id>  # Get AI help
env-coach complete-task <task-id>

# Send custom prompts to AI
env-coach llm-cycle --prompt "How do I implement JWT authentication in Rust?"
```

## Project Structure

- `project.json` - Project configuration and backlog
- `.env-coach/` - env-coach specific files (cache, logs)
- `README.md` - This file
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules (includes env-coach entries)

## Commands Overview

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `env-coach init` | Initialize project (uses current directory) |
| `env-coach status` | Show project status and LLM connectivity |
| `env-coach add-requirement "..."` | Convert natural language to user stories |
| `env-coach list-backlog` | View all backlog items |
| `env-coach list-stories` | View user stories only |
| `env-coach start-task <id>` | Start working on a task |
| `env-coach assist-task <id>` | Get AI assistance for a task |
| `env-coach complete-task <id>` | Mark task as completed |
| `env-coach llm-cycle --prompt "..."` | Send custom prompt to AI |

## LLM Configuration

env-coach uses Ollama by default. Make sure you have:

1. [Ollama installed](https://ollama.ai)
2. Ollama running: `ollama serve`
3. Model downloaded: `ollama pull deepseek-coder:6.7b`

The LLM configuration is stored in `project.json` and can be customized.

## Development Workflow

1. **Initialize**: `env-coach init`
2. **Add Requirements**: `env-coach add-requirement "feature description"`
3. **Review Backlog**: `env-coach list-backlog`
4. **Start Task**: `env-coach start-task US-001`
5. **Get Help**: `env-coach assist-task US-001`
6. **Complete**: `env-coach complete-task US-001`
7. **Repeat**: Continue with next tasks

REQUIREMENT TO ANALYZE: "{{requirement}}"

Please respond with a JSON object containing a single key "user_stories".
The value of "user_stories" should be an array of JSON objects, where each object represents a user story.
Each user story object must have the following fields:
- "title": A brief, descriptive title for the user story.
- "story": The user story in the format "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [reason/benefit]".
- "priority": The priority of the user story. Valid values are "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low".
- "effort": An estimated effort for the user story, as an integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8).
- "acceptance_criteria": An array of strings, where each string is a specific, testable acceptance criterion.

Focus on:
1. Breaking down the requirement into appropriate user stories.
2. Writing clear and concise acceptance criteria.
3. Estimating effort and assigning priority based on typical software development projects.
4. Tailoring acceptance criteria to be actionable and testable, considering the project's tech stack if relevant.

Generate 2-5 user stories that comprehensively cover the requirement.
Return *only* the valid JSON object, starting with `{` and ending with `}`. Do not include any other text or explanations outside the JSON structure.

Example of a single user story object:
{
  "title": "User Login Feature",
  "story": "As a registered user, I want to log in to the application so that I can access my personalized content.",
  "priority": "High",
  "effort": 3,
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    "User can enter credentials (username/password).",
    "System validates credentials against stored user data.",
    "Successful login redirects to the user dashboard.",
    "Failed login shows an appropriate error message."
  ]
